### 🏆 Recognition

I'm proud to share that this project won **2nd Place** 🥈 in the **Codédex Digital Garden Challenge**!  
Out of many incredible entries, my interactive pixel-art garden stood out for its creativity, execution, and calming experience.

Big thanks to the Codédex community for the support and inspiration 🌱✨

### 🌿 Project Overview

As spring approaches, I wanted to create a digital space that celebrates new beginnings, mindfulness, and creativity.  
My project is an **interactive pixel-art garden** where users can type a word and "plant" it — watching it bloom into a unique flower. Each word is tied to a specific plant species, and the background includes relaxing visual and ambient elements for a peaceful experience.

> It's a tiny pocket garden you grow with words 💬🌸

- Soil textures and grid tiles for planting areas
- User interface icons and supporting visuals
